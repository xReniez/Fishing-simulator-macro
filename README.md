# Fishing-simulator-macro

This macro was made for a passion project between 6/20/24 and 7/4/24. The project will more than likely not be updated however I may make more systems alike this one in the near future.

Macro is mostly designed for max level fishing rods, level 50 on everything besides luck.
Macro comes with 2 custom editable settings 

Settings:
- Reel Time (The time it takes for you to get a fish on the hook)
- Click Amount (how many times you have to click before the fish catches)

Keybinds:
(F1) clicking f1 will start the macro as well as stop the macro.
(F3) if you have issues with the macro clicking this key will force close the entire macro.

Uninstall info:
Simply delete the exe off your computer and thats it!
